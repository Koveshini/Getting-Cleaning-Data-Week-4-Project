# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Project

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the data for the project:

## Purpose of the Project

To demonstrate your ability to collect, work with and clean a data set.

## Goal of Project

1. A tidy data set.
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
3. A code book called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data. 
4. A README.md in the repo with your scripts. this repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

### The R script should perform the following 5 functions:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
